## ANZ_Internship_Data
This task is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.

The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data.

This project is about gathering some useful information from the dataset like:

1. what is the average transaction amount?

2. How many transactions do customers make each month, on average?
3. Dataset segmentation by transaction date and time.
4. Visualising transaction volume and spending over the course of an average day or week
